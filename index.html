                <p>Born 1st December, 1987; in South Hatibandha, a small village of Gaibandha District in the northern part of Bangladesh. 2nd of 3 children in the family. Has an older brother and younger sister.</p>
                <p>The family was part of a bigger family. Altogether there were 10 members including parents, siblings, grandparents, uncle, aunts and cousins with only 2 earning members. Since the country was still new and political landscape was still unstable, the economical condition was poor for most of the people of Bangladesh, not just for this family.</p>
                <p>Early childhood was just roaming around the village, playing with siblings and cousins, learning to read arabic from grandparent, all in all fun. Lived in the village until the age of 4 and then moved to Dhaka, capital of Bangladesh with the family.</p>

              <p>Hi! I'm Ada, Countess of Lovelace and am an English mathematician and writer, chiefly known for my work on Charles Babbage's proposed mechanical general-purpose computer, the Analytical Engine.</p>
              <p>I am one of the first to recognize that machines have applications beyond pure calculation, and to have published the first algorithm intended to be carried out by such a machine.</p>
              <p>In my free time I like to read about scientific developments, mathematics, and computational mathematics. I also like to take my chances of winning big.</p>
              <p>Fun fact! I've been programing for 6,592,965,201 seconds!</p>
