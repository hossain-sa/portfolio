                <p>Born 1st December, 1987; in South Hatibandha, a small village of Gaibandha District in the northern part of Bangladesh. 2nd of 3 children in the family. Has an older brother and younger sister.</p>
                <p>The family was part of a bigger family. Altogether there were 10 members including parents, siblings, grandparents, uncle, aunts and cousins with only 2 earning members. Since the country was still new and political landscape was still unstable, the economical condition was poor for most of the people of Bangladesh, not just for this family.</p>
                <p>Early childhood was just roaming around the village, playing with siblings and cousins, learning to read arabic from grandparent, all in all fun. Lived in the village until the age of 4 and then moved to Dhaka, capital of Bangladesh with the family.</p>

            <div class="section-body-text">
              <p>Joined Paikpara Govt. Primary School in 1992, then went on to Bashir Uddin Ideal Secondary School in 1997. Passed Secondary School Certificate (SSC) exam in 2002 from Science group and went to BCIC College in 2002 for Higher Secondary Studies. Passed Higher Secondary School Certificate (HSC) exam in 2004 from Science group. Joined BSc (Hons) in Electrical and Electronics Engineering in Stamford University Bangladesh in August 2005. Finished the course in August, 2009 with a CGPA 3.77 out of 4. Took a break from study, got into work and then went back to Jahangirnagar University, Bangladesh for Masters in Information Technology in May, 2017. Due to various family, work and financial reasons, the course took longer time to finish. Eventually, completed the course with a CGPA of 3.60 out of 4 in August 2021.</p>
              <p>With a dream of continuing higher studies to become an academic and a hope to achieve a better life, took admission in Geomatic Engineering course offered by University of Calgary, Canada, in 2021. Could not travel there because of the will of higher power. But, the dream of becoming a renowned academic still remains.</p>
              <p>Friends used to call Syed a "scientist" partly because he was always curious by nature and partly because they wanted to make of fun of him. Although he was always in the top 5, he was not the best of students. Friends used to wonder how he studies less but always scores higher than them. Teachers knew him as the "only question" student because, even if nobody had any questions in the complete class, he used to ask at least one, no matter the topic. This trend continued from secondary school to the university.</p>
              <p>Syed was always curious about science, technology and how things worked, why they were needed and how things could be made better. These made him choose the field of Computing even though he studied Electrical and Electronics Engineering.</p>
              <p>Syed used to play cricket, football, badminton, chess and all kinds of physical sports and used to be better at all of them compared to his friends. When computer games i.e. video games start to become commonplace, he was good at them as well.</p>
              <p>Besides sports and video games, reading comic books, novels, history books, technology magazines, newspapers were part of his daily routine. He used to write poems and eassys on the problems he saw in his society and country. He used to make plans on how he would solve some of the problem when he grows up.</p>

              <p>Still carrying the dream of becoming someone useful for the family, relatives, friends, society, country and the world. There is still plenty to do in this life even though the resources are limited. Still wants to keep trying to leave something useful for humanity and all existence.</p>
